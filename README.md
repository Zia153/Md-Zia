"Even though we have lost our land, we have not lost our spirit, our identity, or our strength. Our unity is our greatest power. Together, we can rebuild, not just in one place, but wherever we stand. Letâ€™s remember our shared history, hold on to our dreams, and support each other in every step forward. United, we are unstoppable."
